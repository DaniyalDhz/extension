# extension
- Timer should only start once Start button is hit & act as stopwatch & go up instead of down as a countdown.
- Once submit button is hit timer should be reseted & run once start is hit. Also canâ€™t hit submit if input is empty
- Once timer is done it should dropdown to the browser & make a beep sound
- The timer should first display the time (i.e. 30 seconds) and then run it
- The extension should look like ShouldBeLike.jpg in the GitHub repo
Probably the simplest project you would ever do. Please don't hesitate to ask any questions along the way.
